# FeatureCloud app devleopment

In this repository we will exemplify how one can develop FeatureCloud applications and test it natively.

The app development process is extensively covered in our medium publication: 
[Federated Learning with FeatureCloud](https://medium.com/developing-federated-applications-in-featurecloud)

The native mode is exclusively explained in [FeatureCloud in practice](https://medium.com/developing-federated-applications-in-featurecloud/featurecloud-in-practice-c335e3985f62) story.
